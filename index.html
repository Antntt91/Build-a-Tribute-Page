          <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Ada Lovelace's life:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1815</strong> - Ada Lovelace was born Augusta Ada Byron to poet Lord Byron and Anne Isabelle Byron in London on the 10th December. Her parents divorced 5 weeks later and Anne took Ada to live with her grandmother, Judith. Anne wanted Ada to be tutored in maths like she herself had been, to prevent Ada having a similar temperament to her father.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>1824</strong> - Her father Lord Byron passed away when Ada was eight years old.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1828 </strong> -  Aged twelve, Ada wrote Flyology, a book on the dynamics of flight.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1829</strong> - A serious case of measles left Ada paralysed, only regaining the ability to walk with crutches in 1831.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1833</strong> - Mary Somerville introduced Ada to Charles Babbage who showed her his Difference Engine, a machine that could perform simple calculations. They stayed in touch, writing letters to each other. Babbage joined Mary Somerville as a mentor to Ada, who was present during the initial discussions of Byron’s more advanced Analytical Engine.
              1835 Married William King, who in 1838 was made the Earl of Lovelace; making Ada Countess of Lovelace.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1836-1839</strong> - Ada had three children named Byron, Anne, and Ralph Gordon.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1840</strong> - Although she had studied it growing up, Ada wanted to study maths further to better understand Babbage’s work. He recommended maths professor Augustus De Morgan as a tutor.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1842 – 1843</strong> - Ada began translating Notions sur la Machine Analytique, an article based on notes from Babbage’s talk in Turin written in French by Luigi Menabrea. While translating, she corrected Menabrea’s errors and at Babbage’s suggestion, added her own notes A, B, and D to G. Note G is described as the first computer programme. This ‘translation’ was three times as long as the original article. She signed her own contributions A.A.L. and in collaboration with Babbage, Notes was published in Taylor’s Scientific Memoirs. Ada was the first to posit that numbers read by the machine could substitute music notes or letters, thus conceptualising wider applications for computers beyond maths alone.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1850 </strong> - With help from Babbage, Ada attempted unsuccessfully to create a mathematical model to predict gambling odds.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1852</strong> - Ada Lovelace died of uterine cancer aged 36 on the 27th November.
            </li>
           
          </ul>
          <h3>Legacy</h3>
         <p>Ada Lovelace’s Notes influenced Alan Turing’s way of thinking and had an undeniable impact on computer programming a century before early computers were even built. There are awards and a programming language, ADA, named for the countess. Her legacy has survived for almost two centuries thus far.
